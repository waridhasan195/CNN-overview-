# CNN-overview-

Our CNN model gives the best validation accuracy of 95% for our dataset. In Fig 4.4.4.1 we show that training accuracy and validation accuracy are satisfiable because it makes a little bit noise and successfully avoids overfitting. Fig: 4.4.4.2 shows that training loss is losing significantly. Our CNN gives high validation accuracy from InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNet.
